        <h3 class="specific-heading">SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTELLIGENTLY ALERTING OVERTAKING MANOEUVRES USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND ALGORITHMS TO ENHANCE ROAD SAFETY</h3>        </h2> <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>India has one of the largest road networks in the world, and the issue of road safety is increasing with the increase in the rate of motorization and growing urbanization. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least one out of 10 people killed on road across the world is from India.
        <br><br>During the year 2021, a total number of 4,12,432 road accidents have been reported in the country, claiming 1,53,972 lives and causing injuries to 3,84,448 persons. Unfortunately, the worst affected age group in Road accidents is 18-45 years, which accounts for about 67 percent of total accidental deaths. Out of 4,12,432 road accidents, 1,03,639 accidents (25.7% of total accidents) are caused due to overtaking or rash driving, resulting in 42,853 deaths and injuries to 91,893 persons.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>General Description</h2>
        <p>This system can be attached to any vehicle without much effort and does not need to be embedded into the vehicle. This system uses the camera, laser sensor, and ultrasonic sensors to detect the incoming vehicle and indicate a signal to the vehicles behind to alert them about oncoming vehicles to avoid crashes or accidents due to the inter-collision of vehicles while overtaking.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Existing technology</h2>
        <p>
            There isn’t any existing technology similar to our system. There is a system in Samsung safety truck that uses a simple camera and screen to display the front view of the truck through a camera attached to the front of the truck so that the driver can see if there is any oncoming vehicle. This allows drivers to have a better view when deciding whether it is safe to overtake. Even though it is a great idea but it can’t be used by the majority of small truck agencies as you have to maintain it properly and small damage to the camera or screen can make the whole system useless. Our system is a one-time installation device and it will not be a problem in continuing the work as usual.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Unlike the Samsung safety truck that uses a simple camera and screen, our system uses a camera, laser, and ultrasound to detect the vehicles in front of our vehicle and then the system will send an indication signal to the signal setup installed at the back of the vehicle so that the driver behind the vehicle gets alerted about the oncoming vehicle and take the appropriate decision to overtake or not.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Drawbacks / Problems / Challenges in the Existing System</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Can’t alert any vehicle behind about the oncoming vehicle</li>
            <li>There isn’t any system to alert about the oncoming vehicles that can be used in all types of vehicles.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h2>Proposed invention</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed invention is designed to prevent accidents while overtaking, decrease deaths due to overtaking, and reduce the risk of accidents caused by sudden braking or animals crossing the road. The invention is specially designed to prevent deaths caused due to accidents that occur due to rash driving and overtaking.
            <br><br>This invention uses sensors like ultrasonic, laser, and digicam to scan the motors with good accuracy. This device makes use of distinct sensors to detect the car with higher accuracy as small changes within the environment could have a massive impact on the result which can cause a huge twist of fate. As an example, if the device stumbles on the wrong distance of the oncoming car and alerts the driver behind the vehicle with the wrong signal then the driver who depended on the signal and overtake the car can end up in a coincidence. To save any accidents like this we use different sensors to detect the oncoming automobile.
            <br><br>Then the sensor sends this information to the Arduino which is connected to the circuit board. The sensor and the circuit board are organized in a manner that it will not affect any everyday lifestyles of the driver. The circuit board makes use of the caused sign the driving force using the vehicle and the motive force riding at the back of the car. The led alerts the driver in the back of the vehicle through the led sign system attached behind the car to alert the driver behind about the oncoming cars. The led signal indicates the distance of the oncoming automobiles through the frequency of the led. The led frequency is primarily based on the gap between the oncoming vehicle from the car with the machine. With this system, the driver can decide whether it is safe to overtake or not.
        </p>

        <h2>Inventive features</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This AI-based automatic system can detect oncoming vehicles.</li>
            <li>This system detects an oncoming vehicle and alerts the drivers behind the vehicle through an indication system.</li>
            <li>This system can be used at the night too. The led light will be more visible at the night compared to the morning.</li>
            <li>It reduces the risk of accidents caused by sudden braking or animals crossing the road.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This system alerts the driver about the incoming vehicle and helps to avoid vehicle collisions while overtaking.</li> 
            <li>It may reduce the risk of accidents caused by sudden braking or animals crossing the road.</li>
            <li>This system can be used in both morning and night as led light will be more visible at the night compared to the morning.</li>
