        <h3 class="specific-heading">SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY GRADING STORAGE OF ONIONS USING AN ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE ENABLED ELECTROMECHANICAL PROCESS</h3> <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Farmers are facing a large number of onions loss during the post-production of onions due to poor storage management. Although the traditional method of making onion husks saves money, the loss of onions in this storage is huge and these storages are not economically viable for long period. We designed this storage system to overcome this storage problem and avoid the wastage of onions during the storage period.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>General Description</h2>
        <p>This system first uses an improved traditional grading System to separate a large number of onions based on their Size. After onion size grading, the system will predict the quality of Onions through an image processing algorithm. Farmers can use this system to divide a large number of onions in less time. Then, onion Quality can be predicted using an AI Algorithm to identify the best and poor-quality onions before storing them in cold storage. Farmers can use this System to divide many onions in less time. Then, onion quality can be predicted using an AI algorithm to identify the best and poor-quality onions before storing them in cold storage.
        <br><br>The system ensures good-quality onions are stored in cold storage and poor-quality onions are either separated or used for different purposes. This system helps economic gain by reducing sprouting Losses, which could be as high as 10 – 15%.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Existing technology</h2>
        <p>
            Onion, a widely consumed vegetable across the country throughout the year, is mainly cultivated in three seasons i.e., during Kharif, late kharif, and rabi. The crop harvested during the rabi accounts for 60% of onion production and hits the markets from March to June.
            <br><br>In India there are different types of storage structures based on cost and need, they are Naturally ventilated structures, low-cost thatched roof storage, bottom and side ventilated storage structure, and cold storage structure. 
            <br><br>
        </p>

            <img src="../images/patent details images/bamboo hut storage.png" class="learn_more_image">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 1: Bamboo Hut Storage</div>
        <p>
            <br>The whole solid bamboo is used for pillars and roof beams. Half-split bamboo is used for the floor while the sidewalls are made of split bamboo (1/6). The pillars of the whole bamboo are erected at five feet distance. The iron angle supports are provided for all pillars. The bottom ventilation is provided with bricks fixed at the base of all iron angle pillars. The roof is usually made with sugarcane leaves but similar types of grasses can be used for this purpose. The inner lining of gunny cloth is provided to check the leakage of rainwater. This type of structure should be made in the North to South direction. 
            <br><br>Onions are prepared for onion cold storage in India by lowering the temperature to the maximum by 0.5 ° C per day to reach the ideal cold storage temperature little by little. Depending on the variety of onions, they are stored between 0 ° C and +2 ° C in cold storage. Onions can be stored in cold storage for up to 10 months without spoilage. Ventilation is vital in onion storage. After storage, the onions are not transported directly from cold storage before marketing but instead are heated under controlled temperature conditions to avoid condensation.
            <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>There are also traditional Onion Storage Structures: like Kanda chhap.: This is a traditional method of storing onions, where onions are tied in bundles using straw and hung from the ceiling of a room. This method is widely used in rural areas, Bins: Wooden or mud bins are used to store onions. These bins are filled with onions and covered with straw to prevent moisture and sunlight from entering, Matka: Matka is a clay pot used for storing onions. Onions are kept in these pots and covered with a cloth to prevent moisture and sunlight from entering.
            <br><br>Onion storage in ventilation conditions is quite satisfactory when the temperature is maintained between 25oC to 30oC with a relative humidity range of 65% to 70%. The Onion is a semi-perishable crop and 30-40% of the crop gets lost during storage. This environment reduces storage losses, which are in the form of physiological loss in weight, rotting, and sprouting.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Drawbacks / Problems / Challenges in the Existing System</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Low storage duration of onions due to improper temperature control</li>
            <li>Durability and strength of the storage structure</li>
            <li>Can’t identify the present condition of the onions stored in the storage</li>
            <li>Can’t separate the bad onions stored in a large number of onions as they can affect other onions</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h2>Proposed invention</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed invention is designed to save time, improve rural storage Infrastructure, and save poor-quality products that have high chances of degradation. The invention is specially designed to make farmers’ infrastructure modern and easy to use for onions after harvesting.
            <br><br>After harvesting, the onions are sorted by size, and the onions are first placed on different shelves in the warehouse. Onions are separated into three sizes: small, medium, and large. Then, the sorted onions are stored in the rotary motor box. The rotary motor of the box mixes the onions so that the onions from the bottom can be brought to the top of the grid so that the sensor can scan each onion stored in the rotary motor box.
            <br><br>Then, the stored onions in each rotator motor box are scanned through the real-time thermal camera and sensors to identify the quality of the onions. The quality of the onions can be differentiated by their temperature through an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm. The AI algorithm identifies the quality of the onions and differentiates the sprouted and defective onions from the normal onions.

            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The defective onions identified by the AI algorithm are separated through the claw mechanism. Each motor rotator box has a claw mechanism to separate the defective onions. The number of boxes can be designed based on the space available to store the onions as per the requirement.  
            <br><br>Overall, an AI-based automatic onion grading system would help to improve the efficiency of the onion grading process and ensure that only the best quality onions are made available to consumers.
